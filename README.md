## existing notes

building up the network with time dynamics

-bin the network by month
     -we'll get like 60 months?
-build the network for first month, then could just find what changes each month

train machine learning algorithm to predict where things are coming in.
the framework for this seems hard.
what could I feed to Eureqa?

1. base network
2. new nodes
3. delete nodes
4. new edges
5. delete edges
 --> main aim is to predict the new nodes with new edges

predict something. then decide whether that means edges or nodes.


but if we can reconstruct the network, how do we gain any knowledge
